"""
Models Package for Thades' TwitchLurkerbotHunter.

This package provides the SQLAlchemy (MySQL) data models and Pydantic validation for the Lurkerbot
Hunter's data model.

Submodules:
- _validator_regexes: Helper file with regexes used for data validation in multiple places.
- scanning_session: Represents a series of viewer-list fetches from a set of live streams.
- secrets: A single row table to hold a single access and refresh token pair and associated
metadata.
- stream_categories: A table mapping Twitch stream category ID ('game_id') to name ('game_name').
- stream_viewerlist_fetch: Represents a viewer-list fetch event for a given live stream, as well as
data about the live stream and the streamer.
- suspected_bot: An extension on the Twitch User Data table with additional metadata and metrics
collected for accounts that have been classfied as lurker bots.
- twitch_user_data: Every login name observed by this app will have an entry here with 'Get User'
data.
- viewer_sightings: An events-style table where login names that are observed in viewer-lists pulled
during a scan are recorded; login names appearing more than once in a given scan will appear more
than once on this table with the same scanning_session_id, which is a big part of classifying a
lurker bot.
